            <h2>Non_vegetarian</h2>
            <p>Non-vegetarian food (in Indian English sometimes shortened to non-veg food[1]) contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any other animal), and sometimes, eggs.<br>
                 The term is common in India, but not usual elsewhere. In the generally vegetarian environment of India, restaurants offering meat and fish usually have a "non-vegetarian" section of their menu,<br>
                  and may include the term (typically as "Veg and Non-veg") in their name-boards and advertising. When describing people, non-vegetarians eat meat and/or eggs, as opposed to vegetarians.[2][3][4] But in India, consumption of dairy foods is usual for both groups.</p>

            <p>The diet, non-vegetarianism[5] is the majority human diet in the world (including India).<br>
                 Non-vegetarians are also called omnivores in nutritional science.[8]Around 91-92%[11] of humans worldwide are non-vegetarian in that they are neither ovo-lacto- vegetarians nor vegans, according to a 2018 survey by Ipsos Mori.<br>
                  74% of the world's population "Regularly eat both animal and non-animal products", 14% "Only occasionally eat meat or fish", and 3% "Do not eat meat but do eat fish".<br>
                   Only 3% are vegan, i. e. eat no animal products at all.</p>
