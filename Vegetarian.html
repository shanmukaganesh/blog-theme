            <h2>Vegetarian</h2>
            <p>Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat <br>
                (red meat, poultry, seafood, insects, and the flesh of any other animal). It may also include abstaining from eating all by-products of animal slaughter.[1][2]<br>

                Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient animal life.<br>
                 Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs as well as animal rights advocacy.<br>
                  Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, taste-related, or relate to other personal preferences.</p>

            <p>There are many variations of the vegetarian diet:<br>
                 an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs.<br>
                  As the strictest of vegetarian diets, a vegan diet excludes all animal products, and can be accompanied by abstention from the use of animal-derived products, such as leather shoes.

            <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. <br>
                The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.<br>
                 An alternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition.<br>
                  It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.</p>
