            <h2>Foodie</h2>
            <p>A foodie is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food,[1] and who eats food not only out of hunger but also as a hobby.<br>
                 The related terms "gastronome" and "gourmet" define roughly the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure; the connotation of "foodie" differs slightlyâ€”a sort of everyman with a love for food culture and different foods.<br>
                  Some, such as Paul Levy, say the foodie can still be a "foodist"Foodies are a distinct hobbyist group. <br>
                  Typical foodie interests and activities include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling, food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, food distribution, food fads, health and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary tourism, and restaurant management.
